# Raytracing
A raytracing algorithm built from the ground up using JavaScript and the HTML5 canvas to render 3D scenes.

Shoots a simulated ray of light from every pixel on screen and calculates its interactions with objects to create a realistic 3D rendering. Implemented: planes, spheres, textures (via DataURI), shadows.

Example render:
